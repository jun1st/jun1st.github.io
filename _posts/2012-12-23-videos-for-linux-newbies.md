These three videos give a brief introduction to Linux, more specifically ubuntu, and how to setup Linux as your Rails server. After the three videos, totally around 50 minutes, you'll be able to play around with an Amazon EC2 instance.

These videos are published on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), but the site is not accessible from China, so I uploaded to [Youku](http://youku.com) under the permission of the producer, Rob Conery.
